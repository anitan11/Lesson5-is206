These apps are made as an assignment on the University of Agder, where 
every student was going to solve the problem sets of the CS253-cource
on Udacity.com.

I have not made my code for it to go through the validation in the course.
The functionality is still there, but the limitations that was set for
udacity to be able to rund their tests on my code, is not there, like 
the url to the blog. Udacity's limitations was that it had to be set as 
/blog/? but I made it only /blog. There are several like these limitations
I did not follow, mostely to illustrate that I understand the code.

I have only commented main.py in lesson 5 and 2. This is because rot13 is
only in lesson2, and lesson 5 contains the complete blog.

Because of safety, codes containing hashing and salt should not under any 
circumstances for Ã¥ proper webapplication stay inside the same file as
the rest of the code. This is done here inn this assignment only to make 
it work, and because the data entered is not legit.
